# Hello-World
First Github repository

Soooo I'm Simon, hello. To be honest im not very sure of what i'm actually doing here but anyway.

I've just completed the tutorial... Still quite lost on what exactly this platform is used for. 
Would be stoked for someone to give me a bit of a helping hand on my coding journey.
